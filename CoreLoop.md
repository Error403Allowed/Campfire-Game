Deep Sea Descent

Core Loop
1. Player descends submarine deeper into the ocean
2. Oxygen depletes gradually; pressure increases with depth
3. Player avoids hostile creatures and environmental hazards
4. Discover ancient ruins or points of interest for bonus depth/score
5. Eventually fail (oxygen/pressure/enemy) or choose to surface
6. Score based on maximum depth reached and survival time

Controls
Arrow Up / W   (Ascend)
Arrow Down / S   (Descend faster)

Arrow Right / D   (Move right) 
   

Win/Lose Conditions
Lose Conditions:  
Oxygen reaches 0%   → Suffocation; mission failed
Pressure exceeds 100%   → Hull rupture; submarine destroyed
Enemy collision   → Creature destroys submarine

Win Condition:  
No fixed win state   — Success is measured by:
Maximum depth reached
Survival time (in seconds)
Ruins discovered (bonus points)
High score leaderboard

Optional Surface Escape:  
Player can voluntarily ascend to surface to end run and lock in score

   

Key Mechanics  
Oxygen drain:   −0.5% per second (increases at deeper levels)
Pressure buildup:   +0.1% per meter descended
Enemy spawning:   Hostile creatures appear at 500m+ depth, frequency increases
Ruins:   Random placement; grant +500 points and brief oxygen refill
Atmosphere:   Darkness increases, HUD becomes minimal, tension rises
